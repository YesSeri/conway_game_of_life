# Conway's Game of Life

A simple simulation

## Start game

If you use the command `cargo run -- --time 80 --size 20` the game will run at 1 fps (1000ms) and the size of the grid will be 10 by 10.

When the game starts you can initiate the grid in the way you want by entering column and row to flip. `-` is a dead cell and `*` is an alive cell. Press c to continue.
